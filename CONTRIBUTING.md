# Contributing to hypr-opaque-media

Thank you for your interest in contributing to hypr-opaque-media! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Ground Rules

- **Be respectful**: Treat all contributors and users with respect and courtesy.
- **Test your changes**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- **Follow the code style**: Use the project's formatting and linting tools.
- **Write clear commit messages**: Follow conventional commit format when possible.
- **Update documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with your changes.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git

### Setting up your development environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hypr-opaque-media.git
   cd hypr-opaque-media
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install ruff black pytest watchdog
   ```

5. Optionally, install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Running Linters and Tests

### Linting and Formatting

Before committing, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Run ruff linter
ruff check .

# Run ruff with auto-fix (recommended)
ruff check --fix .

# Check formatting with Black
black --check .

# Apply Black formatting
black .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest test/test_core.py

# Run tests with coverage (requires pytest-cov)
pip install pytest-cov
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

The tests use mocking to simulate Hyprland interactions, so you don't need a running Hyprland session.
